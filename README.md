# Killing the Raavan: Unleash the Demons Inside You
- Welcome to a transformative journey that beckons you to delve deep into the recesses of your being. "Killing the Raavan" is an empowering project that invites you to confront and embrace your inner demons, those hidden aspects that may hold you back or inhibit personal growth.
- In the spirit of the legendary tale of Lord Rama's victory over the formidable demon king Raavan, this project draws inspiration from the epic Ramayana.
- Much like Ravan's ten heads revealed various aspects of his character, our project encourages you to confront your own ten traits - strengths, weaknesses, fears, and desires - that shape your identity.
